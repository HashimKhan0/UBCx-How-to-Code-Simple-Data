# Conditional Expressions
* in writing conditional statements the question and answer is wrapped in square brackets to convey they are Q&A 
* every question expression must produce a boolean except for the last expression whose question is now an else
* to evalaute a cond expression
    - if there are no q&a pairs signal an error
    - if the first question is not a value, evalaute it and replace it with its value(replace with a new cond with first expression as value)
    - if first question is true replace entire cond expression with the first answer
    - if it is false cdrop the first q&a pair and replace with new cond expression where first answer is not false

# Data Definitions
* in many applications of programming we take an arbitrary problem and apply numerical(data) to these ideas
* to reduce the strain of tracking what represents what, we use data definitions and interpret our data back into information efficiently
