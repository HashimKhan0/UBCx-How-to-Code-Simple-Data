* when we are changing domains in our function we will need a helper function.
  * if we are inserting images into a list in order of size, we need to check if one is larger than the other
  * in our insert function we will not code in the check but, use a helper function to check instead.

* it is key to remember that throughout the process of using many helpers will have a domino effect when the last helper is complete
* as each helper needs a newer helper if our tests are well formed then we will go from many of our tests failing to all passing
