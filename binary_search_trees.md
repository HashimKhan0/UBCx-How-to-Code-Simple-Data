* in this module how the structure of data affects performance, especially when it omes to the time required to find an element in a large data store
* here we will discover a new self-referential form of data, the binary search tree

# List Abbreviations
    - previous notation for lists involved using cons for each element
    - the new notation allows us to simply write out a list and the reason for the cons is that when adding an element to a list
    - (cons 0 LIST1) will append 0 to list1
    - (list 0 LIST1) will result in (list 0 LIST1) which is a list in a list
